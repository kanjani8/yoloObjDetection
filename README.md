Object Detection with YOLOv3 on Google Colab

Project Overview
This project is a simple task focused on implementing and understanding object detection using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) within the Google Colab environment. YOLOv3 is a powerful deep learning algorithm known for its speed and accuracy in detecting objects in images or video streams in real-time. By leveraging Google Colab's free GPU resources, this project aims to provide a hands-on experience with one of the cutting-edge technologies in computer vision.

Objectives
To understand the fundamentals of YOLOv3 and how it performs object detection.
To implement YOLOv3 within Google Colab using Python.
To evaluate the performance of YOLOv3 on various datasets.
To explore the capabilities and limitations of object detection models.
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
